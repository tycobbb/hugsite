    <h2>Situating Play</h2>
    <p>Your niece has just turned 6 and she’s getting into the classics. Crisp booster pack in hand, you head over for a visit.</p>
    <p>The two of you open it together excitedly, each pulling at its 4 corners. The cards spill out, her eyes widenening. The monsters are pretty cute. And one is foil!</p>

    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>You’re out on your own on for the day, far away home. You meet a stranger and get to chatting, an hour or two evaporates.</p>
    <p>They realize what time it is and pull a small card protector out of their pocket that you recognize immediately.  You each lay your cards on the table. The winds aren’t in your favor today, and a few black sharpie marks later your new friend departs with your Lumpy 8.</p>

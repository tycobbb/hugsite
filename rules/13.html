        <h2>The Performance</h2>
        <p>This is not the only possible Performance of <span class="Term">The Reunion</span>, but it’s one you may want to use for your first game (or, perhaps all of them).</p>
        <p>Place your <span class="Term">Partner Kin</span> face up in front of you. See them. See your friend’s Partner Kin. See your friend. If the two of you agreed on a greeting, exchange it now.</p>
        <p>Shuffle your remaining four Kin and set them to the side face down. Choose the first player.</p>
        <p>On the first player’s left, place three cards in a column. The first player places two cards on their side who <b>give</b> their friend’s kin a hug. The hugging kin, and player, mark the hugged kin according to their types.</p>
        <p>On the first player’s right, place three cards in a column. The second player places two cards, and the first player’s kin <b>receives</b> a hug. The hugging kin, and player, mark the hugged kin.</p>

    <h1>The Reunion</h1>
    <p>These are the core rules of the game, but treat them more as guidelines than as rigid walls. If you donâ€™t understand them, let them inspire you. If you want to modify the game and your partner agrees, do it.</p>
    <p>This is a moment to let your cards change.</p>

    <h2>Stakes</h2>
    <p>You and a friend decided that your cards will meet. Before they actually start their reunion, you should talk about what kinds of damage and protection will happen.</p>
    <p>Protections are small marks, reminders that should your card be hurt in the future, the damage will be minimzed to that region.</p>

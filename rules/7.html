        <h2>Impermanence</h2>
        <p>Hopefully that was okay. In this game, you mark, draw on, bend, burn, label, or otherwise change and destroy cards. You might feel precious about them. That’s okay. Good, even.</p>
        <p>While you start with one deck, it won’t be the deck that you end up with. You will lose cards, but you’ll gain new ones, too. There may come a time when you want to save a card forever. You should. However, keep mind that you will want to have enough cards on hand to play with someone, should you be asked.</p>
        <p>Your cards are as much a part of the game as are your tools for changing them. Choose tools you gravitate towards. A sharpie and a shard of danburite are nice. If a ballpoint pen is your thing, use that. Whatever works, as long as it can make a memorable mark on a card.</p>

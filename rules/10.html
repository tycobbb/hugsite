        <h2>Growth</h2>
        <p>From your first hand of cards, until your last, you should remember that this game is about change and growth. Sometimes you might not want to give up any of your cards, but think of it as a gift you are swapping. Your friend is also giving you a part of theirs, and together, you are making the Hugkin travel, meet new friends, and change.</p>
        <p>One of your Kin might be specially dear to you, and you might have it as your <span class="Term">Partner Kin </span>for some time, and all your adventures will be recorded.</p>
        <p>Consider always trading at least one card (the one in the <span class="Term">Crossing</span>). Consider making it a random one, get attached, but also feel excited for letting go, and for receiving new kins.</p>

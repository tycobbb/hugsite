    <h2>Finding Your Team</h2>
    <p>Before you begin, you will need to find your team. There needs to be two of you for this, so hopefully you bring someone else too!</p>
    <p>Once you’ve opened your booster pack, shuffle the cards and deal 5 to yourself and your friend.</p>
    <p>Pick a card from those in your hand and add it to your deck. Choose creatures that call your name, none is better or worse than the other. Pass the remaining cards to your friend. Repeat until you’ve each assembled a deck of 5 cards.</p>
    <p>One at a time, look at your Hugkin. Close your eyes, and find a name for this kin. Write it on the back of the card. You might write, for example: “Edgars’s Gost”.</p>
    <p>Now comes the most important part, your first moment of sharing and letting go. Shuffle all 10 cards together, and deal 5 of them randomly to each player.</p>

    <h2>Regulars</h2>
    <p>You and a friend have been playing this for some time now. Every month, precisely, you get together, hopefully with some new creatures in hand.</p>
    <p>A single card have been going back and forth between you for a while. It seems almost magical, a card never leaving either of your decks since many years ago. </p>
    <p>After so long matter how durable the cards, or how protective the protector, this 2 Softy has aged.</p>
    <p>You decided to make a new spread in honor of it, the theme of retirement vivid on your mind. 2 Softy is in the center, no more marks, just a tear, straing in the center, dividing the card.</p>
    <p>One day, hopefully many months from now, youâ€™ll meet, and each of you will bring your own part of 2 softy home.</p>

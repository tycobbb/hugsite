        <h2>Warm Up</h2>
        <p>From your five Kin, choose one to be your <span class="Term">Partner Kin</span> today. This Kin observes The Reunion and records its history.</p>
        <p>Your remaining four Kin participate in <span class="Term">The Performance</span>, and may become marked by help or hurt. It’s possible that a Kin in The Performance migrates to your friend’s team during the moment of <span class="Term">Crossing</span>.</p>
        <p>This may be the last time you see this team. Take a moment and recognize these Kin as they are now.</p>

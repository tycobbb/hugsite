        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is a game about thinking how will your world be in 20 years.</p>
        <p>20 years ago, during your school days, you and your friends created a very personal artifact.</p>
        <p>You sat down in the library and found as many playing cards as you could. and decided collectively to give personality to them all. Then you came up with a little ritual, where cards could switch caretakers and and change,  permanently.  Each one of you left that day with a small group of cards to take care of for as long as you could. You promised to always have such cards with you, and whenever you met, perform the transformational ritual.</p>
        <p>The ritual is a moment to remember, but also to continue the care. Like a remarkable hug.</p>

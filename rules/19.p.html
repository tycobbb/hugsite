    <h2>Cheating</h2>
    <p>You found out about this Hugkin thing, some of your school colleagues were telling fun stories about their cards the other day. You have just gone through your first reunion, cards fresh.</p>
    <p>Jealous of some of your other friends stories, and in a highly imaginative moment, you decide to mark your own cards, create an amazing history for them with your own marks.</p>
    <p>Some had a streak of lucky protections, while others never got any, getting completely obliterated. One passed owners many times, and met many people. You think how fun it will be to give them to your friends, to have them believe.</p>
    <p>Next day you come to school with these amazing cards, your friends in awe. You are excited to trade, so your stories start spreading.</p>
    <p>You understand the possibilities of this game, you understand that those stories couldâ€™ve been true. Maybe they are. You decide to never do it again.</p>

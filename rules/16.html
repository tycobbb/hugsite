        <h1>Situating Play</h1>
        <p>This game is a ritual for preserving memory. For recalling us to a moment when all that mattered were the creatures in front of us. For scattering moments into the future.</p>

        <h2>Stakes</h2>
        <p>It’s been a while. You moved across the country a few years ago to start a family.</p>
        <p>It was nice getting a chance to catch up, to reminisce. To feel like not a day had passed, if only for a moment.</p>
        <p>But you have to head home again. You take your cards from your wallets, lay them on the table, and play. Your decks change. You leave with your friend’s Spiny 3, and they with your Softy 5. </p>
        <p>Tomorrow, you take out your wallet to pay for groceries. Ah, Spiny. There you are.</p>

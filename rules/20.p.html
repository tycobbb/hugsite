    <h1>Your First Game</h1>
    <p>At some point in time every player is a non-player. How do they find the game? What is their experience like?</p>

    <h2>Four Corners</h2>
    <p>A friend sends you a link to this game’s website, https://hugsite.netlify.app, tells you they’ve been playing for a bit now. On the site, you see a game store near that carries booster packs.</p>
    <p>You get one, but you can’t open it. You need to pull all four corners at once, and you only have two hands. </p>
    <p>You call up another friend, they come over. You open the bootser pack together, 10 cards and 2 card protectors tumble out. You check out the rules, shuffle the deck, and draft your creatures. Haha, “this is Walid’s Hot Bod” you announce as you show off your Softy 3.</p>
